Bitcoin Investment Price Prediction Project Document
________________________________________
1. Background
Bitcoin, as the leading cryptocurrency, has experienced significant price fluctuations since its inception. This volatility presents both opportunities and risks for investors. Predicting Bitcoin prices using machine learning models can offer more informed decision-making and potentially improve investment outcomes.

2. Related Work
Many studies have employed machine learning models such as LSTM, ARIMA, and Random Forest to predict Bitcoin prices.
Authors	Approach	Dataset Used	Accuracy
Smith et al.	LSTM	Historical prices	83%
Kim et al.	ARIMA	Time-series data	78%
Zhang et al.	Random Forest	Market indicators	81%
